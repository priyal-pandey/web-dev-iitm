                <h3><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h3>
                <p class="para">
                    The Arctic is a region of extremes: extreme cold, extreme seasonal changes in daylight, and extreme winds. It sits at the top of world, covered in sea iceâ€”a seemingly unwelcome place for life. Yet the Arctic is actually teeming with wildlife, from large mammals like walruses and polar bears to birds, fish, small plants, and even tiny ocean organisms called plankton.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    The Arctic is a unique ecosystem with a complex food web made up of organisms adapted to its extreme conditions. It is one of the most biologically productive ecosystems in the world, supporting many large fisheries and huge populations of migratory birds that come to the Arctic in the summer to breed.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    Arctic wildlife have special adaptations that enable them to survive in their icy and changeable environment. A large portion of the Arctic region includes the Arctic Ocean, which is home to an amazing array of wildlife, including endangered bowhead whales, endangered polar bears, beluga whales, endangered ringed seals, and Pacific walruses.

            <h3>Beluga Whale</h3>

                <p class="para">
                    The beluga whale (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) is an Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean, known for its white color and high-pitched calls. It is the only species in its genus and one of two members of the Monodontidae family, alongside the narwhal.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    Belugas are adapted to life in the Arctic with features like an absence of a dorsal fin and a large, deformable melon used for echolocation. Males can grow up to 5.5 m (18 ft) and weigh up to 1,600 kg (3,530 lb). They are social, form groups of about 10, and can dive to 700 m (2,300 ft). They live in Arctic waters around North America, Russia, and Greenland, with a population of about 200,000.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                   Hunted for centuries, belugas still face threats like predators, pollution, climate change, and disease. Some populations are endangered, particularly in Cook Inlet and parts of Canada. Belugas are also popular in captivity due to their gentle nature and communication skills.

                <p class="para">
                    The polar bear (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>) is a large bear native to the Arctic, closely related to the brown bear. It is the largest bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300-800 kg (660-1,760 lb). Females are smaller, and the bear has white or yellowish fur, black skin, and thick fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with sharp teeth for cutting meat and large paws for walking on ice and swimming.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    Polar bears are both terrestrial and ice-dependent, considered marine mammals due to their reliance on marine ecosystems. They prefer sea ice but live on land in summer. Mainly carnivorous, they prey on seals, especially ringed seals, and also hunt walruses, beluga whales, and terrestrial animals. They are solitary but may form groups on land, with males guarding females during breeding. Mothers give birth in winter maternity dens, and cubs stay with their mother for up to 2.5 years.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    The polar bear is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN, with an estimated population of 22,000 to 31,000. Climate change, pollution, and energy development threaten the species, as melting sea ice limits access to prey, causing malnutrition and increased human conflicts. Polar bears have been hunted for their fur and other body parts and are popular in captivity, art, and culture.

                <p class="para">
                    The snowy owl (<i>Bubo scandiacus</i>) is a large, white owl native to the Arctic regions of North America and the Palearctic. It is one of the largest owl species and the only one with mostly white plumage. Males are generally purer white, while females have more dark markings. Juvenile males are darker until they mature.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    Unlike most owls, snowy owls are often active during the day, especially in summer. They are generalist and specialized hunters, mainly preying on lemmings but also other small mammals, birds, and carrion. They nest on the tundra and lay large clutches of 5 to 11 eggs, with staggered hatching.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    Snowy owls are nomadic and migratory, breeding in different locations each year. Their global population is declining, with fewer than 100,000 individuals remaining, down from over 200,000. The decline is likely linked to environmental factors, possibly related to global warming.

                    <p class="para">
                        The Arctic fox (<i>Vulpes lagopus</i>), also known as the white fox, polar fox, or snow fox, is a small fox native to the Arctic regions. It is adapted to cold environments with thick fur for warmth and camouflage, and a fluffy tail. Its body length ranges from 46 to 68 cm (18 to 27 in), with a rounded shape to conserve body heat.

                    </p>
                    <p class="para">
                        The Arctic fox preys on small animals like lemmings, voles, and seal pups, as well as carrion, berries, and insects. It forms monogamous pairs during breeding and raises young in underground dens, sometimes with help from family members. Its natural predators include golden eagles, wolves, polar bears, and grizzly bears. Most Arctic foxes live less than a year, but some can survive up to 11 years.

                    The reindeer (or caribou, Rangifer tarandus) is a species of deer native to Arctic, subarctic, and northern regions of Europe, Siberia, and North America. It is the only species in its genus, with some studies suggesting six distinct species. Reindeer can be migratory or sedentary, with herd sizes varying by region. </p>

                <p class="para">
                    They are adapted to extreme cold, and some subspecies are migratory. Reindeer vary in size and color, from the small Svalbard reindeer to the large Osborn's caribou. Some species are declining and considered vulnerable. Uniquely among deer, female reindeer can have antlers, depending on the subspecies.</p>
                <p class="para">
                    Reindeer are the only large-scale semi-domesticated deer, providing food, clothing, and shelter for Arctic peoples. They are also featured in Christmas legends, where Santa's reindeer pull his sleigh on Christmas Eve.</p>
